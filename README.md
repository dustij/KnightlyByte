> "Good software solves real problems and feels effortless to use."

I'm a **Computer Information Science** undergraduate who builds websites, automation scripts, trading bots, and data tools using **Java, TypeScript, and Next.js**. I focus on writing **clean, maintainable code** and refining systems until theyâ€™re **simple and reliable**.

Software should remove friction, not add to it. Whether automating a task or improving a workflow, I look for ways to make things **work better with less effort**.
