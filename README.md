# üëã Hi there, I'm Dusti Johnson

I'm a Computer Information Science (CIS) student at Washburn University and an aspiring software developer passionate about full-stack solutions, web applications, desktop applications, and automation scripts. I love building things that solve real problems, make life easier, or are just plain fun!

## üåü Highlights
- **ClumsyCat Solana Token**: Launched the ClumsyCat token on the Solana network, complete with a tradeable market and a live [website](https://www.clumsycatsol.com/). Check out the project: [ClumsyCat Clawz](https://github.com/dustij/clumsycat-clawz).
- **Java Learner**: Currently diving into Java at school, fascinated by type safety. I've explored Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and have a growing interest in Rust and lower-level programming with C or C++.

## üöÄ What I Do
- **Full-Stack Development**: I build applications that span the whole stack, from backend logic to interactive frontends.
- **Automation Scripts**: I love creating scripts to improve productivity, analyze data, and even power game bots.
- **Collaborative Projects**: I'm interested in working on small projects with other developers (especially beginners!) to solve everyday problems, like budgeting, finance tracking, and productivity tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, Django, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Java, Maven
- **Libraries & Tools**: pandas, NumPy, PyAutoGUI, OpenCV, PyQt5, Drizzle ORM, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, JavaFX

## ‚ú® My Approach
When I work on a project, my goal is to quickly find a solution and get something up and running. Seeing things in action fuels my creativity and helps me improve. I'm a big fan of refactoring and even starting over when I find a better way forward. I also love using tools like ChatGPT to help with writing documentation, planning features, and debugging code (maybe even had a little help with this README üëÄ).
